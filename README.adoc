== Purpose
. simple test framework to determine health of the both TCP, UDP unicast and UDP multicast networks
. this tool can also identify whether a particular UDP multicast socket is already being used and by whom

NOTE:  
jgroups provides org.jgroups.tests.McastSenderTest / McastReceiverTest out of the box : https://access.redhat.com/site/solutions/123073

== Usage 

. compile project
.. cd into this project's root directory
.. execute: mvn clean install

. execute project
.. review javadocs in source for further commands to start test framework

== wireshark filter
igmp.type || tcp.port == 45588 || udp.port==45588

== possible routing table modifications
(as root)  route add -net 239.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 eth0
